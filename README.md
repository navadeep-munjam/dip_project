# 🕵️‍♂️ Forensic Classification of Imaging Sensor Types

This project implements a forensic system to classify whether a digital image was captured by a *camera* or generated by a *scanner. The classification is based on **sensor pattern noise analysis* and *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* learning.

## 📚 Abstract

Digital images may come from a variety of sources such as cameras or flatbed scanners. Forensic analysis often requires determining the origin of such images, especially in legal and investigative scenarios. This project leverages the inherent differences in *sensor noise patterns* between scanners and cameras and uses a *feature-based machine learning approach* to classify the source of the image.

Creates a pipeline with PCA dimensionality reduction and SVM classifier

Uses GridSearchCV to optimize SVM hyperparameters (C, gamma, kernel)

## 🧠 Feature Extraction
Extracts statistical features (mean, median, variance, kurtosis, skewness) from these correlations

The "Denoising via Wavelet Transform (LPA-ICI analog)" refers to an advanced noise removal technique that combines wavelet thresholding with principles from Local Polynomial Approximation (LPA) and Intersection of Confidence Intervals (ICI) for adaptive denoising. This method is particularly effective for preserving edges and fine details while suppressing noise.


We extract features from the *correlation of sensor noise* across image rows and columns:

- *1st-order statistics*: Mean, Median, Mode, Max, Min  
- *Higher-order statistics*: Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis  
- *Ratio*: Mean(Row Correlation) / Mean(Column Correlation)

*Total features: 17*
